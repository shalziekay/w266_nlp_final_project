# Detecting Sarcasm in Reddit Comments 
## w266 Project

Shalini Kunapuli and Lavanya Vijayan

The use of sarcasm and irony on social media allows us to study and model them in depth. We look at the SARC (Self Annotated Reddit Corpus) dataset, which contains 1.3 million comments from Reddit. Using this corpus, we approach sarcasm from both supervised and unsupervised directions. We build transformer models to classify Reddit comments as sarcastic or non-sarcastic, evaluate the models for accuracy, and compare to baseline and prior work done in this area. We also exploit the concept of cloze questions to create language models, which are then used to assign soft labels to our examples. We discuss complexities of identifying sarcasm due to thoughts being multi-faceted, words having various connotations, and the context of Internet slang.
